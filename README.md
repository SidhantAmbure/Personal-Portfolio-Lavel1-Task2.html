# Personal-Portfolio-Lavel1-Task2.html
This HTML code represents a simple portfolio webpage for a web developer. It consists of different sections:

1. **Header Section**: Displays the developer's name, a job title ("Web Developer"), and a profile image.

2. **Contact Information Section**: Contains details such as email, LinkedIn profile link, and GitHub profile link.

3. **Skills Section**: Lists the developer's skills like HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. More skills can be added as needed.

4. **Projects Section**: Shows a list of projects with titles and brief descriptions. Additional projects can be added as required.

5. **Resume Section**: Provides a link to download the developer's resume in PDF format.

The code uses HTML elements like headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`), paragraphs (`<p>`), lists (`<ul>`, `<li>`), images (`<img>`), and hyperlinks (`<a>`). It also references an external stylesheet (`styles.css`) to control the webpage's appearance and layout.
